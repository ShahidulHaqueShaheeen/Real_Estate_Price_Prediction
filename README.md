# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction

This project involves building a predictive model to estimate real estate prices based on historical data.  
The model utilizes several regression techniques to improve prediction accuracy, making it useful for property buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Overview
- Developed a predictive model to estimate real estate prices using various features like location, size, and number of rooms.  
- Used Python with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-Learn** for data preprocessing and model building.  
- Implemented **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** algorithms to enhance accuracy.  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Adjusted RÂ²**.
